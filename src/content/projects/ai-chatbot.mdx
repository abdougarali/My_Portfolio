# AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot

An intelligent customer support chatbot that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 API to provide instant, accurate responses to customer inquiries while maintaining context throughout conversations.

## Problem

Many businesses struggle with providing 24/7 customer support due to high costs and limited availability. Traditional chatbots often provide generic responses that don't address specific customer needs, leading to poor user experiences and increased support tickets.

## Solution

I developed an AI-powered chatbot that combines the intelligence of GPT-4 with custom business context to provide personalized, accurate customer support:

- **Intelligent Responses**: Uses GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains conversation history and business-specific knowledge
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket-based chat for instant responses
- **Custom Training**: Fine-tuned with business-specific data and FAQs
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Track conversation quality and customer satisfaction

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands customer intent and context
- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Maintains context across multiple exchanges
- **Intent Recognition**: Identifies customer needs and routes appropriately
- **Response Generation**: Creates human-like responses tailored to the business
- **Fallback Handling**: Escalates to human agents when needed

### Business Integration
- **Knowledge Base**: Integrates with existing documentation and FAQs
- **Product Information**: Access to real-time product data and inventory
- **Order Management**: Can check order status and provide updates
- **Escalation System**: Seamlessly transfers complex issues to human agents
- **Multi-language Support**: Handles conversations in multiple languages

### Analytics & Monitoring
- **Conversation Analytics**: Track response times, resolution rates, and satisfaction
- **Performance Metrics**: Monitor chatbot effectiveness and improvement areas
- **A/B Testing**: Test different response strategies and optimize performance
- **Error Tracking**: Identify and resolve issues quickly
- **Custom Dashboards**: Business-specific analytics and reporting

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with real-time chat interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express and Socket.io for real-time communication
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4 API with custom prompts and context
- **Database**: MongoDB for conversation history and analytics

# E-Commerce Platform

A modern, full-stack e-commerce platform that provides a seamless shopping experience for customers and comprehensive management tools for administrators.

## Problem

Traditional e-commerce solutions often lack modern user experiences, have complex admin interfaces, and don't scale well with growing businesses. Many existing platforms are either too expensive for small businesses or too complex for simple use cases.

- **Admin Dashboard**: Intuitive interface for managing products, orders, and customers
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast loading times and smooth user experience
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built to handle growth from startup to enterprise

## Key Features
